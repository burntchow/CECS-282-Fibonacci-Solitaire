# Fibonacci-Solitaire
## Project 1

Like regular soliaire but with a twist! Behold Fibonacci Solitaire.
For this game you are able to:
* Display Deck - Displays all 52 cards 
* Shuffle Deck - Shuffles the cards 
* Play Solitaire 
* Exit

Play Solitaire option is more of an auto play, CPU will figure out how many piles of 
Fibonacci numbers you were able to make given the order of the deck.
The goal is to end in a Fibonacci number else the piles don't matter.
